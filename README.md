# TV-Script-Generation
Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree `TV Script generation` project

Introduction In this project, we generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We will be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
